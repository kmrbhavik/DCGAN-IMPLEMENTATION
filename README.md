# DCGAN-IMPLEMENTATION
Implementation of a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the architecture, training process, and generated results of DCGANs.

---

This repository contains the implementation of a **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)** to generate realistic handwritten digits. The project is based on the MNIST dataset, a widely used dataset for digit classification and generation tasks.

---

## **Project Overview**

The DCGAN architecture uses two primary components:
1. **Generator**: Generates new handwritten digits from random noise.
2. **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and generated handwritten digits.

The adversarial training process helps the generator learn to produce realistic digits while the discriminator improves its ability to detect fake samples.

## **Features**
- Implements a DCGAN using Tensorflow.
- Trains on the MNIST dataset for generating 28x28 grayscale handwritten digits.
- Includes detailed visualizations of training loss and generated digits.
- Customizable hyperparameters for experimentation.
